# Capability Status

## Capability

Collaborative Scenario Playback

## Current phase

Target Assessment Lead product definition

## Overall status

Phase 1 is merged; the first shared artifact is defined as a draft Target Assessment Lead pending Product decisions and role review

## Accepted direction captured

- The product direction is a collaborative workspace where humans and agents jointly own tasks and artifacts.
- Every agent must provide a concrete functional advantage.
- A scenario may start from a supported object, investigation, question, or prepared context.
- The demo uses an explicitly labeled historical replay.
- Specific targets and records are reference fixtures, not capability semantics.
- Phase 1 excludes individual Investigation Memory item selection.

## Who needs to act now

| Role | Status | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Product | Decision needed | Approve the artifact definition and answer its four acceptance questions. |
| Development/Architecture | Waiting | Review persistence, revision, and target-workflow separation after Product approval. |
| UX | Waiting | Review proposal, correction, rejection, and assessment-handoff messages after Product approval. |
| QA/Security | Waiting | Review provenance, contradiction preservation, and promotion-boundary tests after Product approval. |

## Current blockers

- No Phase 1 blocker remains.
- The Target Assessment Lead draft requires Product approval before role reviews and execution planning.
- Broader manifest, adapter, and trigger decisions remain deferred beyond Phase 1.

## Current risks

- Future evidence may leak through retrieval paths not covered by replay filtering.
- A first demo deployment may still use global state and interfere with concurrent users.
- Automatic reevaluation may race with repeated stage changes.
- Over-generalization may produce an abstract framework without a compelling first experience.
