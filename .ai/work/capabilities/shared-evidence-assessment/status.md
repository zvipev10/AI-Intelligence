# Capability Status

## Capability

Collaborative Scenario Playback

## Current phase

Phase 1 Slice 2 accepted

## Overall status

Slice 1 merged; Slice 2 chat-based workstream creation is accepted and ready to merge

## Accepted direction captured

- The product direction is a collaborative workspace where humans and agents jointly own tasks and artifacts.
- Every agent must provide a concrete functional advantage.
- A scenario may start from a supported object, investigation, question, or prepared context.
- The demo uses an explicitly labeled historical replay.
- Specific targets and records are reference fixtures, not capability semantics.
- Phase 1 excludes individual Investigation Memory item selection.

## Who needs to act now

| Role | Status | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Product | Approved | No action. |
| Development/Architecture | Approved | No blocking PR feedback; proceed. |
| UX | Approved | Human accepted the implemented checkpoint. |
| QA/Security | Approved | Automated checks accepted with the documented manual-browser limitation. |

## Current blockers

- No blocker remains for Slice 2 merge.
- Broader manifest, adapter, and trigger decisions remain deferred beyond Phase 1.

## Current risks

- Future evidence may leak through retrieval paths not covered by replay filtering.
- A first demo deployment may still use global state and interfere with concurrent users.
- Automatic reevaluation may race with repeated stage changes.
- Over-generalization may produce an abstract framework without a compelling first experience.

## Next expected artifact

Merge Slice 2, then define the next capability slice for shared artifacts and agent contribution.
