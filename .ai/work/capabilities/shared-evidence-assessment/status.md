# Capability Status

## Capability

Collaborative Scenario Playback

## Current phase

Target Assessment Lead role review

## Overall status

Phase 1 is merged; Product approved the first shared artifact and Development/Architecture, UX, and QA reviews are next

## Accepted direction captured

- The product direction is a collaborative workspace where humans and agents jointly own tasks and artifacts.
- Every agent must provide a concrete functional advantage.
- A scenario may start from a supported object, investigation, question, or prepared context.
- The demo uses an explicitly labeled historical replay.
- Specific targets and records are reference fixtures, not capability semantics.
- Phase 1 excludes individual Investigation Memory item selection.

## Who needs to act now

| Role | Status | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Product | Approved | No action. |
| Development/Architecture | Review needed | Review persistence, revision, and target-workflow separation. |
| UX | Review needed | Review natural-language proposal, correction, rejection, and assessment-handoff messages without an artifact label. |
| QA/Security | Review needed | Review provenance, contradiction preservation, and promotion-boundary tests. |

## Current blockers

- No Phase 1 blocker remains.
- Execution planning is blocked until the artifact-specific role reviews are ready.
- Broader manifest, adapter, and trigger decisions remain deferred beyond Phase 1.

## Current risks

- Future evidence may leak through retrieval paths not covered by replay filtering.
- A first demo deployment may still use global state and interfere with concurrent users.
- Automatic reevaluation may race with repeated stage changes.
- Over-generalization may produce an abstract framework without a compelling first experience.

## Next expected artifact

Artifact-specific Development/Architecture, UX, and QA review.
